# Hello, I'm Tanat! ðŸ‘‹

# Grade Tracker

The purpose of this web page is to provide a tool for calculating one's cumulative GPA and semester GPA based on the coursework completed in the fields of Computer Science or Information Technology at Assumption University. Additionally, the web page offers a graphical representation of an individual's academic GPA journey through the utilization of a line chart.

The web page is designed to prevent the addition of duplicate subjects and will display an alert if an attempt is made to add a subject that already exists.
